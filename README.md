Hello! This is my final project for Policy and Data Studio at NYU Wagner.
I chose to analyze the effectiveness of New York City's Civilian Complaint Review Board, which oversees the NYPD. I did this with both descriptive statistics and a series of regression analyses.
You can find a companion article I wrote about my findings here:https://medium.com/@patricklitke0899/undermined-underfunded-an-analysis-of-the-civilian-complaint-review-board-9e2c6fb15da4

The code comments should be sufficient to explain what is happening, but if you run into problems on reg_and_plot, run the cleaning documents separately first. I don't know why, but this always fixes any issues.
Besides that, it should run from scratch fine.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
